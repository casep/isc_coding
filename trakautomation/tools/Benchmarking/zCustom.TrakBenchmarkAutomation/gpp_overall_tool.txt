Automation needed:


RANDREAD: (in ZPERFTOOLS.rsa)
* do $system.OBJ.Load("/tmp/ZPERFTOOLS.rsa","ck")
* Assume user creates target database
X find target performance: jobs, IOPS, peak IOPS, service time (6ms with ECP, 10ms without ECP)
* Itterations - number of cycles done by each process
* Args: total itterations, target response time
* Start 1, 2, 4 ....
* processes until 5 consecutive steps < target response time && processes >= 32

.... but that don't tell us the IOPS - for that we need to run "iostat", parse the data.
.... and that isn't good since it could give erratic results (buffering and merging)


Better would be if we could time the run....
.... maybe calculate it from the results: 1/latency * Processes






GMASH
* Take namespace argument
* Import new suits.rsa if available
* Check for ^GMASH availability
